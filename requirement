Overview
========
In this test you will be creating a basic HTTP service with a JSON API.
The service you will build is a bird registry and it will support the following requests:

 - `GET /birds` - List all birds
 - `POST /birds` - Add a new bird
 - `GET /birds/{id}` - Get details on a specific bird
 - `DELETE /birds/{id}` - Delete a bird by id

No update method is required.

 - Write this in the language you feel most comfortable with
 - Any web framework is accepted
 - Document how to build and run your application
 - Document how to run the test suite
